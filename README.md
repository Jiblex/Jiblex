I'm a recent graduate with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems. Lover of long (and strong) passwords and a security enthusiast. 

## Objective

Having started my tech journey in computer science, I switched to something I found cool since I was a child and found a passion for cybersecurity. I am now eager to join this field and become a professional, specifically aiming for roles such as Security Analyst or SOC Tier 1 analyst.
